# fluido

It means _fluid_ in Italian, and yes, this is **yet another streaming lib**.

## Why

On _npm_ you can find a plethora of libs useful to work with the Node.js streams.
The main problem is that the majority of those libs was created to fill some
lacking feature inside Node.js, but starting from the version 10 of Node.js,
a lot of those _hacks_ are not necessary anymore.

This package aims to be a streaming toolkit that makes advantage of
the last improvements of Node.js, and remove all the unecessary
_hacky_ code and dependencies.
